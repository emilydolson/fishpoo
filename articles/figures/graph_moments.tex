\caption{Moments of the co-phylogeny graph from Figure \ref{fig:adjacency}. Degree, betweenness centrality, and density are traditional graph properties which can be calculated using {\tt igraph}. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to a node. Betweenness is a measure of how `central' a node is within the graph. The density is the ratio of the number of edges to the number of possible edges. Squareness and occupancy are moments specific to co-phylogenies. Squareness is the ratio of the number of taxa in the `host' tree to the number of taxa in the `guest' tree. Occupancy is the ratio of the number of links between taxa to the number of taxa.  }
